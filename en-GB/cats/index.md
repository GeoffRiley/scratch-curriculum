# CATS!

In this project, you will create a simple line-following game in Scratch. Guide the cats to safety, and donâ€™t let any of them fall through the gaps!

### Instructions

Click and drag with the mouse to draw a line with the pencil. Your objective is to stop the cats falling to their doom by creating a safe path to the exit.
