#Learning Objectives
+ Sensing blocks:
	+ `key ... pressed?` {.blocksensing};
	+ `distance to mouse pointer` {.blocksensing};
	+ `touching color ...` {.blocksensing}.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

#Challenges
+ "Winning!" - use of `touching color ...` {.blocksensing} block;
+ "Sound effects" - adding sound and music to the game;
+ "More obstacles!" - consolidating learning of sensing blocks;
+ "More boats!" - use of `key ... pressed?` {.blocksensing} blocks;
+ "More levels!" - additional player-controlled backdrops.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ This is the first project in which much less step-by-step guidance is given. Use this as an opportunity to consolidate learning, and to start drawing on knowledge learnt in this and previous projects. 

	For example, if children need help adding sound effects and music to their game, remind them of the work they did in the 'Rock Band' project. Encourage children to go back and look at the previous project notes for guidance.
