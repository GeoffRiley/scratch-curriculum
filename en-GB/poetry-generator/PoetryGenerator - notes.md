---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use variables and lists to make their own random poetry.

#Ada Lovelace Day
This project has been created to celebrate Ada Lovalace Day. If you're a teacher, you can download a School Resource Pack containing which also contains an an assembly plan ([downloads.codeclub.org.uk/ada.zip](http://downloads.codeclub.org.uk/ada.zip)), to introduce children to Ada and her revolutionary ideas.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.
