title: Lost in Space 1.4 â€” Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to combine code blocks to create a simple animation.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 1.4 should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ LostInSpace-1.4.sb

#Learning Objectives
+ Loops:
	+ `Repeat` {.blockcontrol} loops;
	+ `Forever` {.blockcontrol} loops.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

#Challenges
+ "Improving your animation" - altering the numbers in a short program;
+ "Make your own animation" - applying the learning to make a new animation.

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Children may need reminding to 'reset' a sprite's position, size and other effects at the start of their animation. This can be easily achieved by adding some of the following blocks to the start of their animations:

```blocks
	go to x:(0) y:(0)
```

```blocks
	set size to (100)%
```

```blocks
	clear graphic effects
```
